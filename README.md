# DataMining-Algorithms-Implementions

This repository contains implementations of various data mining algorithms, including:

- **Apriori Algorithm**: A classic algorithm for mining frequent itemsets and generating association rules.
- **K-means++**: An improved version of the K-means clustering algorithm that aims to find better initial centroids.
- **K-median**: A clustering algorithm that aims to minimize the sum of the absolute deviations between points and their cluster centers.
